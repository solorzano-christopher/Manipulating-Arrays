# Manipulating-Arrays
Project for class to help us understand Arrays and manipulate them. 
# Assignment information
Counting, summing, computing the mean

Write a method counts the number of elements in an integer array, and then sums the elements in an integer array.
It should return the average of the array elements as a double. Using the count and sum, compute and print the mean of each array.

Reversing arrays

Write a method that accepts an array as an argument and prints the reversed array. For example, if you pass the method Array B,
it should print [9, 7, 5, 3, 1]. Print the reverse of all three arrays.

Rotating arrays

Arrays can be rotated to the right or to the left by any number of places. Rotating an array to the right by two places puts the first element in position three,
the second element in position four, and so on, with the last element in position two and the next to last element in position one.
Array A rotated to the right by two places results in [8, 10, 0, 2, 4, 6]. Likewise, rotating an array to the left places the first elements at the end. 
Array B rotated to the left by two places results in [5, 7, 9, 1, 3].

Write a method that accepts three parameters, a direction (right or left), a number of places, and an array,
which prints the appropriate rotation. Call the method on all three arrays. Rotate array A two places to the left. 
Rotate array B two places to the right. Rotate array C four places to the left.
